# eXtended QR (XQR) Codes

<img src="images/xqr_demo.png" height="100" />

XQR Codes are an extension of QR codes that use JWTs and JWKs to perform validation.
This provides an extra layer of security by proving the person who created the XQR code is who they say they are.

To get started, download the `xqr` CLI from [here](https://github.com/xqr-dev/xqr-cli/releases).
Then scan the above XQR code and pass that value to `xqr decode <XQR_VALUE>`.

_XQR Codes are still in early stages of development and should not be used in production._
